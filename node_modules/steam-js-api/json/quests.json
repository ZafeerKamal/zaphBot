        Currently, I do not know what quest ids are linked to what specific tasks. The only way to
        find out would be to check many profiles with partially completed badges and compare which
        tasks they don't have in common.

        Obviously I do not plan on scraping a lot of random profiles, but I may occassionally go
        through my own friend's list to check if anyone has the same partially completed badges, and
        see if I can't determine a few quest ids from that.

        If you have any of the following badges PARTIALLY completed, as in you did NOT complete each
        task to level up the badge, then please let me know so I could determine the exact ids for
        the tasks. If you know someone who meets those requirement, then please ask them for me!


        * Community badge, the one with a ton of tasks that everyone has.
        * Steam Summer Sale 2012
        * Steam Holiday Sale 2012
        * Steam Hardware Beta Tester
        * Steam Awards Nomination Committee 2016 (HIGHLY WANTED!)
        * Steam Awards Nomination Committee 2017 (HIGHLY WANTED!)
        * Steam Awards Nomination Committee 2018 (HIGHLY WANTED!)
        * Spring Cleaning Event 2018


        That's all! Any badges with tasks that aren't on this list are not needed. If a new badge
        with tasks has been recently released, then I'm probably doing it myself to determine the
        quest ids and won't need help.

        Thank you for reading!"
