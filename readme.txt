To run this app for development, assuming you have the config.json file containing the token.

    In a terminal install nodemon:
        run: npm install nodemon -g
    This installs nodemon globally.

    Once nodemon is installed,
        run: nodemon index.js

    This will deploy the discord bot.

The config file should contain 
    "token": "DISCORD-BOT-TOKEN-HERE";
